<hr>

<h3>Steps to setup the stalk</h3>

1. Make sure kubernetes and helm is already setup on your machine,
2. Clone the repository and `cd` to the `Learning-Helm` directory.
3. Run the command `helm install --name helmKube bankapp` - as this will set up all the object in the _**template**_ directory.
4. Run the command `kubectl get deploy` to verify that all stalk is running.
